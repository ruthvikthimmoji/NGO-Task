# NGO Reporting Web App üåç

This is a full-stack web application built for NGOs to submit monthly reports, and for admins to view a summarized dashboard of the collected data.

## ‚ú® Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RESTful API)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **UI Library:** Shadcn UI (built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## üì∏ Features

- NGO report submission with required fields
- Admin dashboard showing aggregated data per month
- Secure login and role-based access (Admin / NGO)
- Clean and responsive UI using Shadcn UI
- Loading states, empty state messaging, and basic validation

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ngo-reporting-app.git
   cd ngo-reporting-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env.local` file**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

4. **Run the app locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Push the repo to GitHub and connect to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for instant deployment.
   - Add the same environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

## üß† Approach & Learnings

This project was designed to be lightweight, intuitive, and secure.

- I used **Supabase** for authentication and data storage, allowing rapid development with powerful backend-as-a-service capabilities.
- **Shadcn UI** provided a headless component architecture that was easy to customize and fast to implement.
- **Next.js App Router** helped in organizing code cleanly between the NGO and Admin dashboards.

## ‚è≥ Improvements with More Time

- Add role-based routing and more granular access control.
- Implement file uploads (e.g., receipts or event images).
- Add filters and charts to the admin dashboard.
- Write tests (unit + integration) with Jest or Playwright.
